# Product_landing-Page

As a trainee in @Sync Intern as frontend web developer, my #task1 is to create a product landing page. I have a created a (Avalona Organics) product landing page.
As I have created many ecommerce projects websites, this is not a big deal for me. But by creating small porjects, I improve my skills and I create this landing page as a practice because practice makes man perfect.
